### Some Explanations
- According to the rules of the competition, we cannot upload the data of the competition, if you need it, you can contact me.
- It is also worth mentioning that we did not achieve good results in this modeling competition, but I think some of the visualizations are very satisfying to me, so I specially uploaded this code for your reference and learning.
- In addition, all the codes for this competition are written by myself, so I have the right to upload them.



### Tips
*If you have any problem, you can send an email archercym@gmail.com or make an issue directly. We can discuss together.*
